# Return on Investment (ROI)

ROI (Return on Investment) measures the efficiency of an investment by comparing the gain relative to its cost. It is calculated as:

\[
ROI = \frac{\text{Net Gain from Investment} - \text{Cost of Investment}}{\text{Cost of Investment}} \times 100
\]

### Example:

Suppose an initiative costs **£500,000** and results in a net gain of **£1,200,000**.

\[
ROI = \frac{1,200,000 - 500,000}{500,000} \times 100 = \frac{700,000}{500,000} \times 100 = 140\%
\]

This means the investment generated a **140% return** over its initial cost.
