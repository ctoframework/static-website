## Finance

A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) doesnâ€™t need to be a finance expert, but they must have a strong understanding of financial principles to align technology investments with business goals. Their knowledge of finance should cover the following areas:

- Budgeting & Cost Management
- Return on Investment (ROI) for Technology
- Revenue & Business Models
- Fundraising & Investor Relations (for startups & scale-ups)
- Financial Risks & Compliance
- Key Financial Metrics for a CTO
- Scaling & Financial Planning

A great CTO understands how technology impacts financial health, ensuring that tech investments support sustainable growth and profitability.
