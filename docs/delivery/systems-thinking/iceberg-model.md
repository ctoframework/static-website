# Iceberg model

The **Systems Thinking Iceberg Model** is a framework used to analyze complex systems by looking beyond surface-level events to understand underlying patterns, structures, and mental models that shape those events. It helps in identifying root causes rather than just reacting to symptoms. The model is visualized as an iceberg, where only a small portion is visible above the surface, while the deeper, more influential layers remain hidden below.

## **Layers of the Iceberg Model:**

### 1. **Events (Tip of the Iceberg – What We See)**

- These are the observable occurrences or symptoms of a system.
- **Example:** A company experiences a sudden drop in customer satisfaction.

### 2. **Patterns & Trends (Just Below the Surface – What’s Been Happening?)**

- Repeated behaviors or trends over time that indicate systemic issues.
- **Example:** Customer complaints have been rising steadily over months.

### 3. **Systemic Structures (Deeper Level – What’s Causing This?)**

- The organizational, social, economic, or technological structures influencing behavior.
- **Example:** Poor customer support due to understaffing and lack of training.

### 4. **Mental Models (Deepest Level – What Assumptions Drive the System?)**

- Deeply held beliefs, values, and assumptions that shape decision-making.
- **Example:** Leadership assumes cost-cutting is more important than customer service quality.

## **Why Use the Iceberg Model?**

- Helps shift focus from reactive problem-solving to proactive system redesign.
- Encourages addressing root causes rather than surface-level symptoms.
- Supports long-term, sustainable change by altering structures and mental models.
