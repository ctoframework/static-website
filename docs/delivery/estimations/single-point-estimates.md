# Single-Point Estimates

A **single-point estimate** is a specific numerical value assigned to an uncertain quantity in project management, cost estimation, or risk analysis. It represents a **best guess** or **most likely value** for a given parameter, such as time, cost, or effort required to complete a task.

## Key Aspects of Single-Point Estimates:

1. **Fixed Value** – It provides a single number instead of a range (e.g., "Task A will take 10 hours").
2. **Simplicity** – It is easy to use and communicate.
3. **Assumptions-Based** – It often relies on expert judgment, past data, or simple calculations.
4. **Risk of Inaccuracy** – Since it does not account for variability or uncertainty, it can be misleading if the actual value deviates significantly.

## Example:

A project manager estimates that developing a new software feature will take **15 days** based on past experience. This is a **single-point estimate** because it does not consider best-case or worst-case scenarios.

## Alternative Approaches:

- **Three-Point Estimation (PERT)** – Uses optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely values to account for uncertainty.
- **Range Estimates** – Provides a minimum and maximum to reflect variability.
