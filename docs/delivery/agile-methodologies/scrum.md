## Scrum

Scrum is a lightweight Agile framework that helps small teams work collaboratively in an iterative and incremental manner.
Key Aspects of Scrum:

- Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
- Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
- Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment.
- Time-boxed Iterations: Called Sprints (typically 2-4 weeks).

Scrum is best suited for small, cross-functional teams working on complex projects requiring frequent feedback and adaptation.
