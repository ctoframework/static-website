## SAFe

SAFe is a framework designed to scale Agile practices for large enterprises. It provides structured guidance on roles, responsibilities, and workflows to implement Agile across multiple teams.
Key Aspects of SAFe:

- Four Configurations: Essential SAFe, Large Solution SAFe, Portfolio SAFe, and Full SAFe.
- Agile Release Train (ART): Aligns multiple teams working toward a common goal.
- Program Increment (PI) Planning: A large-scale planning event for synchronizing multiple teams.
- Lean-Agile Principles: Combines Agile, Lean, and DevOps practices.
- Roles: Includes Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Release Train Engineers, and more.

SAFe is best suited for large organizations that need to coordinate across multiple teams and departments while staying Agile.
