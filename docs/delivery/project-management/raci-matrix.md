# RACI Matrix

A **RACI Matrix** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed) is a project management tool used to define roles and responsibilities for tasks, processes, or deliverables within a project. It helps clarify who is doing what and ensures accountability.

## RACI Definitions

- **R (Responsible):** The person or team **doing the work** to complete the task.
- **A (Accountable):** The person who **owns the work and makes final decisions**. There should be only one per task.
- **C (Consulted):** People who provide **input and feedback** before work is completed.
- **I (Informed):** People who need to be **kept updated** on progress but are not involved in execution.

## Example RACI Matrix

| Task/Activity       | Project Manager | Developer | QA Tester | Stakeholder | Legal Team |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Define Requirements | A               | C         | I         | R           | C          |
| Develop Feature     | I               | R         | C         | I           | I          |
| Test Feature        | I               | C         | R         | I           | I          |
| Approve Deployment  | A               | I         | I         | C           | R          |
