# Project management triangle

The **Project Management Triangle** (also called the **Iron Triangle** or **Triple Constraint**) is a model that represents the key constraints of any project:

1. **Scope** – The features, functionalities, and deliverables of the project.
2. **Time** – The project timeline, deadlines, and schedules.
3. **Cost** – The budget, resources, and financial constraints.

The core idea is that **changing one constraint affects the others**. The principle is often summarized as:

> _"Fast, cheap, or good—pick two."_

## **Application in Software Engineering**

### **Example 1: Tight Deadline (Time Constraint)**

A company wants to release a new **mobile app** within **3 months**. To meet this deadline:

- **Scope might need to be reduced** (e.g., launch with only essential features).
- **Costs might increase** (e.g., hiring extra developers or using third-party tools to speed up development).

### **Example 2: Limited Budget (Cost Constraint)**

A startup has **a fixed budget** for building an **e-commerce platform**. To stay within budget:

- **Time might need to be extended** (e.g., a smaller team takes longer to develop).
- **Scope might be reduced** (e.g., launch with a basic checkout system, adding features later).

### **Example 3: High-Quality Features (Scope Constraint)**

A client wants a **feature-rich CRM system** with **AI-powered analytics and automation**. To achieve this:

- **More time might be needed** (e.g., thorough development and testing phases).
- **Higher costs might be incurred** (e.g., hiring AI experts, using cloud services).
