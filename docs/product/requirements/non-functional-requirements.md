# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

## What Are Non-Functional Requirements?

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define the **quality attributes, system constraints, and operational characteristics** of a system.  
Unlike **functional requirements**, which specify what a system should do, non-functional requirements describe **how well** the system performs, behaves, or operates.

## Key Categories of NFRs

1. **Performance** – Speed, responsiveness, and throughput  
   _e.g., "The system must process 1,000 transactions per second"_
2. **Scalability** – Ability to handle increased load  
   _e.g., "The system must support 10,000 concurrent users"_
3. **Reliability & Availability** – System uptime and failure recovery  
   _e.g., "99.99% uptime required"_
4. **Security** – Protection from unauthorized access  
   _e.g., "All user data must be encrypted"_
5. **Usability** – User experience and ease of use  
   _e.g., "Users should complete registration in less than 2 minutes"_
6. **Maintainability** – Ease of system updates and bug fixes  
   _e.g., "Code should have at least 80% test coverage"_
7. **Portability** – Ability to run on different environments  
   _e.g., "The application must be compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS"_
8. **Compliance** – Adherence to legal and regulatory requirements  
   _e.g., "System must comply with GDPR"_

## Why Are NFRs Important?

- Ensure **system stability, security, and performance**.
- Affect **user satisfaction** and **business success**.
- Impact **architecture and technology choices**.
- Must be defined early to **avoid costly rework**.
