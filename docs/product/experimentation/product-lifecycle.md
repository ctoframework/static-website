# Product lifecycle

The **Product Lifecycle** in software and technology development consists of several key stages, from initial ideation to eventual retirement. Below are the typical phases, including **Alpha, Beta, LA (Limited Availability), and GA (General Availability)**, along with any other relevant ones.

---

## 1. Ideation & Planning

- This is the **pre-development** stage where ideas are generated, market research is conducted, and feasibility is assessed.
- **Key outputs**: Business case, product roadmap, initial requirements.

## 2. Development (Pre-Alpha / Internal Builds)

- The engineering team starts developing the product, often through iterative or agile methodologies.
- The software is not yet available to external users and is usually tested internally by developers.

## 3. Alpha (Early Testing Phase)

- **Purpose**: Internal or limited external testing of the core functionalities.
- **Audience**: Usually internal teams, selected partners, or early adopters.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Features are incomplete or experimental.
  - Stability is not guaranteed.
  - Focus on identifying critical bugs and gathering early feedback.

## 4. Beta (Public Testing Phase)

- **Purpose**: Broader user testing with external stakeholders, customers, and community members.
- **Audience**: Select external users (closed beta) or a wider audience (open beta).
- **Characteristics**:
  - Most features are implemented but may need optimization.
  - Focus on usability, performance, and user feedback.
  - Bugs are expected but should not be critical blockers.

## 5. Release Candidate (RC) / Limited Availability (LA)

- **Purpose**: A near-final version released to a controlled subset of customers.
- **Audience**: Select customers under special agreements.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Functionally complete with final bug fixes in progress.
  - Used to validate production readiness.
  - Often part of a **soft launch** before full-scale release.

## 6. General Availability (GA) / Full Release

- **Purpose**: The official, stable release for the general market.
- **Audience**: All customers, unless restricted by licensing or geography.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Fully supported by the company.
  - Regular updates and patches provided.
  - Available for purchase or full use.

## 7. Growth & Maturity

- The product gains adoption, revenue, and possibly additional feature updates.
- This phase includes **major updates, maintenance, and security patches**.
- Marketing and customer support efforts are at their peak.

## 8. Decline & End of Life (EOL) / End of Support (EOS)

- **EOL**: The product is no longer actively developed, though some existing customers may still be using it.
- **EOS**: No further updates, patches, or customer support.
- **Replacement**: Customers are encouraged to upgrade or migrate to a newer version or alternative.

---

## Special Terms & Variants

- **Soft Launch** – A phased release to a small segment before full GA.
- **Preview / Early Access** – Limited release to test features before Alpha or Beta.
- **Sunsetting** – A transition period where a product is gradually phased out before reaching EOL.
