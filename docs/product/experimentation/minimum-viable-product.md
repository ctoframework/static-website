# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

A **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early adopters and provide feedback for future development. The goal is to test the core idea with minimal resources before investing heavily.

## Key Aspects of an MVP:

1. **Core Functionality Only** – It includes only the must-have features that solve a problem.
2. **Fast to Market** – It helps validate an idea quickly and cost-effectively.
3. **User Feedback Driven** – Early users provide insights for iteration and improvement.
4. **Reduces Risk** – It prevents wasting resources on unwanted features.

## Why Use an MVP?

- To test a business hypothesis before full-scale development.
- To attract investors with a working prototype.
- To minimize time and cost while refining the product.

## Examples of MVPs:

- **Airbnb:** Started as a simple website renting out the founders' apartment.
- **Dropbox:** Launched with a demo video before building a full product.
- **Facebook:** Began as a limited social network for Harvard students.
