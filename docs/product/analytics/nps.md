# Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric used to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction. It is based on a single survey question:

> _"On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend or colleague?"_

## How NPS Is Calculated

1. **Respondents are categorized into three groups**:

   - **Promoters (9-10):** Loyal customers who are likely to recommend the company.
   - **Passives (7-8):** Satisfied but not enthusiastic customers who may switch to competitors.
   - **Detractors (0-6):** Unhappy customers who may discourage others from using the companyâ€™s product/service.

**Formula:**

\[
\text{NPS} = \% \text{Promoters} - \% \text{Detractors}
\]

The score ranges from **-100 to +100**. A higher NPS indicates stronger customer loyalty.

## Why NPS Matters

- Helps businesses track customer satisfaction over time.
- Identifies areas for improvement based on feedback.
- Strongly correlates with customer retention and growth.
