## 9-boxes

As a CTO (Chief Technology Officer), the 9-Box Model can be a powerful tool for assessing and managing your technical team, ensuring you have the right talent to drive innovation, stability, and long-term growth. Here's how to apply it from a technology leadership perspective.

### How the 9-Box Model Works

The model evaluates employees across two dimensions:

- Performance – Measures an employee’s current contributions, achievements, and results.
- Potential – Assesses an employee’s ability to grow into future leadership roles or take on more responsibility.

Each employee is placed into one of the nine boxes, categorized as follows:

|                    | Low Potential                                           | Medium Potential                                       | High Potential                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| High Performance   | High Performer (Valued contributor, but limited growth) | Strong Performer (Develop for leadership)              | Top Talent (Ready for promotion)                           |
| Medium Performance | Skilled but Stagnant (Needs motivation)                 | Core Employee (Stable and reliable)                    | Emerging Leader (Needs support to grow)                    |
| Low Performance    | Low Performer (May not be a good fit)                   | Underperformer with Some Potential (Needs improvement) | High Potential but Inconsistent (Coachable but struggling) |

### How to Use the 9-Box Model

- Identify high-potential employees: Those in the top-right boxes should be nurtured for leadership.
- Provide targeted development: Employees in the middle should receive coaching and skill-building opportunities.
- Address performance issues: Those in the bottom row may need additional support, reassignment, or in some cases, exit strategies.
