## Personal improvement plan (PIP)

A Personal Improvement Plan (PIP) is a structured framework to help underperforming employees meet specific performance expectations. While often seen as a prelude to termination, a well-executed PIP can serve as a constructive tool for growth and retention.

### Strategic Purpose of a PIP

- Performance Recovery: Helps employees improve in key areas with clear expectations and measurable goals.
- Legal Protection: Serves as documentation in case of disputes, ensuring fair process adherence.
- Cultural Impact: If used constructively, PIPs reinforce a culture of accountability and professional development rather than fear.

### Best Practices for CTOs Implementing a PIP

- Clarity & Transparency: Define precise, achievable goals tied to business objectives.
- Support & Mentorship: Provide coaching, mentorship, and necessary resources to facilitate improvement.
- Realistic Timelines: Typical PIPs range from 30 to 90 days, allowing enough time for progress evaluation.
- Regular Check-ins: Frequent feedback sessions to track progress and adjust as needed.
- Objective Assessment: Measure outcomes against predefined success criteria, avoiding bias or ambiguity.

### When to Use (or Avoid) a PIP

#### Use a PIP When:

- An otherwise capable employee is struggling with clear fixable issues.
- Performance concerns are impacting team efficiency.
- The goal is genuine improvement rather than a formality before termination.

#### Avoid a PIP When:

- The employee is fundamentally a bad fit for the role or culture.
- The intent is to push someone out rather than help them succeed.
- Leadership has already decided on termination, making the process disingenuous.

### Alternative Approaches

- Coaching & Mentoring: A more informal way to address minor issues before escalating to a PIP.
- Role Adjustment: If skills donâ€™t match the role, consider restructuring rather than forcing improvement in misaligned areas.
- Performance Development Plans (PDPs): A proactive, non-punitive approach that fosters long-term growth for all employees, not just struggling ones.
