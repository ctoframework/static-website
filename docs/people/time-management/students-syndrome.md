# Student's Syndrome

**Student's Syndrome** is the tendency for people to procrastinate and start working on a task only when the deadline is near, leading to rushed and often suboptimal work. The term is commonly associated with students who delay studying or completing assignments until the last moment, but it applies to professionals as well.

## Causes:

1. **Parkinsonâ€™s Law:** Work expands to fill the available time, meaning if a deadline is far away, people delay starting.
2. **Perceived Efficiency:** Some believe they work best under pressure, though this often results in mistakes and stress.
3. **Lack of Immediate Consequences:** When deadlines are distant, procrastination seems harmless.
4. **Overconfidence:** People assume they can finish quickly once they start.

## Effects:

- Increased stress and anxiety
- Lower-quality work
- Higher risk of missing deadlines
- Reduced learning and retention (for students)

## Ways to Overcome It:

- **Set Internal Deadlines:** Break tasks into smaller deadlines.
- **Use the Pomodoro Technique:** Work in short, focused bursts with breaks.
- **Prioritize Tasks:** Tackle the most critical parts early.
- **Accountability:** Tell someone about your deadlines to stay committed.
