# Eisenhower Matrix

The **Eisenhower Matrix**, also known as the **Urgent-Important Matrix**, is a time management tool that helps prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. It was inspired by a quote from former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower:

> _"What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important."_

## How It Works

The matrix divides tasks into four quadrants:

### 1. Urgent & Important (Do First)

- Tasks that require immediate attention and have significant consequences.
- **Examples:** Crisis management, pressing deadlines, urgent issues.
- **Action:** Handle these tasks **immediately**.

### 2. Important but Not Urgent (Schedule)

- Tasks that contribute to long-term success but don’t require immediate action.
- **Examples:** Strategic planning, skill development, relationship-building.
- **Action:** **Schedule** these tasks in your calendar to prevent them from becoming urgent.

### 3. Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)

- Tasks that require immediate attention but don’t necessarily need your involvement.
- **Examples:** Interruptions, unnecessary meetings, certain emails or phone calls.
- **Action:** **Delegate** these tasks whenever possible.

### 4. Neither Urgent Nor Important (Eliminate)

- Tasks that don’t contribute to your goals and are often distractions.
- **Examples:** Excessive social media, binge-watching TV, trivial activities.
- **Action:** **Eliminate** or minimize these tasks to free up time.

## Why Use It?

- Helps **focus** on what truly matters.
- Reduces stress by avoiding last-minute urgencies.
- Improves **productivity** and **time management**.
- Encourages **delegation** and **elimination** of unimportant tasks.
