# Assertive Communication

**Assertive communication** is a way of expressing your thoughts, feelings, and needs clearly, confidently, and respectfully. It strikes a balance between being too aggressive (forceful and disrespectful) and too passive (being ignored or overlooked).

## Key Characteristics of Assertive Communication

1. **Clarity & Confidence** – You state your opinions and needs directly, without hesitation.
2. **Respect for Others** – You acknowledge and consider the feelings and perspectives of others.
3. **Use of "I" Statements** – Instead of blaming, you express your feelings and needs with phrases like _"I feel…"_ or _"I need…"_.
4. **Calm & Steady Tone** – Your voice is firm but not aggressive, showing confidence without intimidation.
5. **Active Listening** – You listen to others and respond thoughtfully, not just waiting for your turn to speak.
6. **Open Body Language** – Good eye contact, relaxed posture, and appropriate gestures reinforce assertiveness.

## Examples of Assertive Communication

- **Passive:** _"I guess it’s fine if we do it your way."_ (Lack of confidence, avoiding conflict)
- **Aggressive:** _"You never listen! We’re doing it my way!"_ (Forceful, disregards others' opinions)
