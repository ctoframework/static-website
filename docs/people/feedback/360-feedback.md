## 360 feedback

360-degree feedback is a performance evaluation method where employees receive feedback from multiple sources, including:

- **Managers** (supervisors or higher-ups)
- **Peers** (colleagues at the same level)
- **Direct Reports** (subordinates)
- **Self-Evaluation** (the employee assesses themselves)
- **External Stakeholders** (customers, vendors, or partners, if applicable)

## Purpose of 360 Feedback

The goal is to provide a **well-rounded** view of an employee's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Unlike traditional top-down reviews, 360-degree feedback reduces bias and gives a more **comprehensive** picture of performance.

## Key Benefits

- **Holistic Perspective** – Insights from multiple viewpoints create a balanced assessment.
- **Employee Development** – Helps employees identify growth opportunities.
- **Reduces Bias** – More objective than feedback from just one person (e.g., a manager).
- **Enhances Self-Awareness** – Employees compare their self-assessment with external perceptions.
- **Encourages Open Culture** – Fosters communication and continuous improvement.

## Common Pitfalls & Challenges

- **Lack of Anonymity** – If feedback isn’t anonymous, honesty may suffer.
- **Misuse as a Performance Tool** – Best for development, not promotions or firing.
- **Feedback Overload** – Too much feedback can be overwhelming if not properly structured.
- **Implementation Complexity** – Requires clear guidelines and a structured process.

## Best Practices

- Ensure **anonymity** (especially for peer and direct report feedback).
- Focus on **constructive, actionable insights** rather than vague criticism.
- Use trained facilitators to **interpret and deliver feedback** effectively.
- Follow up with **development plans** to turn feedback into growth.
