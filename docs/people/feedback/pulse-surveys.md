# Pulse Surveys

A **pulse survey** is a short, frequent questionnaire designed to quickly gauge employee sentiment, engagement, and feedback on key aspects of the workplace. Unlike traditional annual surveys, pulse surveys are conducted regularly (e.g., weekly, monthly, or quarterly) to capture real-time insights and trends.

From a leadership perspective, pulse surveys are valuable for monitoring team morale, identifying potential issues before they escalate, and assessing the impact of new initiatives. The data collected can help in making informed decisions to improve efficiency, collaboration, and overall workplace satisfaction.
