## People

A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) must have strong people-related knowledge and skills to lead teams, align technology with business goals, and foster innovation. Their understanding of people should cover these key areas:

- Leadership & Team Management
- Communication & Collaboration
- Organizational Culture & Team Dynamics
- Negotiation & Stakeholder Management
- Change Management & Adaptability

A great CTO doesn’t just manage technology, they lead, inspire, and empower people to build impactful products and drive the company’s success.
