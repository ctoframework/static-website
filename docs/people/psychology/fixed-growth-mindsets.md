# Fixed vs growth mindsets

A **fixed mindset** assumes that abilities, intelligence, and talent are static traits—you either have them or you don’t. This often leads to avoiding challenges, fearing failure, and resisting feedback. In a technical environment, this can manifest as dismissing new technologies, sticking rigidly to past decisions, or believing that certain individuals are naturally better at problem-solving while others cannot improve. It may also lead to avoiding innovation due to fear of making mistakes.

A **growth mindset**, on the other hand, views abilities and intelligence as qualities that can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence. This mindset embraces challenges, sees failures as opportunities to learn, and values feedback. In a fast-changing environment, this translates to staying open to emerging technologies, continuously improving processes, and fostering a culture where people are encouraged to experiment and learn from mistakes. It also means recognizing that skills can be developed over time and investing in the growth of both individuals and teams.

The difference between these mindsets directly impacts decision-making, adaptability, leadership, and how effectively problems are solved in an ever-evolving landscape.
