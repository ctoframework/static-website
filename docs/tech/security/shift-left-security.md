# Shift-Left on Security

Shift-left on security is a proactive approach that integrates security measures early in the development lifecycle rather than treating security as a final gate before production. This methodology acknowledges that identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities at later stages—such as during testing or post-deployment—can be significantly more costly and complex than mitigating them early in the development process.

## **Core Principles of Shift-Left on Security**

### **1. Security by Design**

Security considerations are embedded from the initial stages of development, starting with architecture and design discussions. Threat modeling, secure coding guidelines, and security risk assessments become fundamental parts of the software development process.

### **2. Developer-Centric Security**

Developers are empowered with security knowledge and tools, enabling them to write secure code from the outset. This involves integrating security training, static application security testing (SAST), and automated code analysis directly into development workflows.

### **3. Automation and Tooling**

Security is integrated into CI/CD pipelines using automated security testing tools such as:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) security scanning

These tools provide continuous feedback, ensuring security vulnerabilities are caught and addressed early.

### **4. Collaboration Between Security and Development Teams**

Traditional siloed security teams are replaced with a culture of shared responsibility, where security is a collaborative effort across engineering, DevOps, and security teams. Security champions within development teams help bridge the gap between security experts and engineers.

### **5. Continuous Monitoring and Threat Detection**

Security does not stop at deployment; it extends to runtime monitoring, anomaly detection, and proactive incident response. This ensures that security is an ongoing process rather than a one-time checkpoint.

## **Benefits of Shift-Left on Security**

- **Cost Reduction** – Fixing security vulnerabilities during the design and development phases is significantly cheaper than addressing them post-production. Studies show that the cost of fixing a bug increases exponentially the later it is discovered.
- **Faster Development Cycles** – By integrating security into CI/CD pipelines, security checks become part of the normal development process rather than a bottleneck at the end.
- **Improved Compliance** – Early integration of security ensures adherence to regulatory and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2) from the start, reducing audit risks.
- **Reduced Attack Surface** – By eliminating vulnerabilities early, organizations decrease their exposure to potential exploits, improving the overall security posture.

## **Implementation Strategies**

1. **Adopt Secure Coding Standards** – Encourage best practices like OWASP Top 10 awareness and secure code reviews.
2. **Integrate Security into CI/CD Pipelines** – Automate security testing as part of every build and deployment.
3. **Use Infrastructure-as-Code Security Tools** – Scan IaC templates (Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.) for misconfigurations.
4. **Promote Developer Security Training** – Conduct regular security awareness sessions to build security-first thinking.
5. **Leverage DevSecOps** – Embed security as a core principle within DevOps practices to ensure continuous security validation.
